<h2>Intro to Web Development</h2>

<h3>What is this club all about?</h3>
An introductory web development club that will culminate in engineers producing their own website. Engineers will learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and discuss good design principles.

<h3>What will we do in this club?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Understand what web development means
  <li>Learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS</li>
  <li>Develop a static website from scratch, using HTML, CSS and flexbox methods</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the expectations for this club?</h3>
<p>Come to the club everyday ready to give your best effort and be open to the challenges of learning something new with your peers! 
</p>
<strong>Length:</strong> 2hrs per lab (10-15 min break) <br>

<h4>Attendance Policy: Engineers are not allowed to miss more than one (1) day of work.</h4>
<p>Engineers must come in to make up for any missing work. Check in with the coach to work out a day you can come in to catch up.</p>

<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Basic computer, how to surf the web and typing skills. 

<h3>Exercise #1</h3>
<p>You will practice adding the elements you just learned and gain confidence and interest by starting to build a custom web page. </p>
Complete the following challenges using <a href="/exercises/lab1.html">lab1.html</a>:
<ul>
  <li>Add a heading</li>
  <li>Add a paragraph</li>
  <li>Update an image</li>
  <li>And more...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercise #2</h3>
<p>You will practice adding HTML elements into the <a href="/exercises/lab2.html">lab2.html</a> file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use div, nav, <header>, <footer>, <body> tags to organize content on the page</li>
<li>Add images to our webpage, including alt tags</li>
<li>Add at least 2 new HTML elements to your webpage</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercise #3</h3>

Color : use in font-color and background
Margin: create space around elements, outside of any defined borders
Text-align: horizontal alignment of text in an element
Borders: add a border to an element. Demonstrate how to set: style, color, width, and corner-radius

<h3>Exercise #4</h3>
Engineers independently continue building their About Me pages based on the planning and design they created. Coach provides assistance if engineers get stuck.  

Day 4 Expectations:
Engineers should finish their About Me  projects today.
Engineers should be expected to demo their work.


<h3>Exercise #5</h3>
Implement basic elements using Flexbox.

The layout
Display:flex
Flex-direction

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/css-flexbox-poster.png" target="_blank">Download the guide here</a>. 

Spend 15 minutes having engineers code-along with this flexbox exercise.


<h3>Exercise #6</h3>
Engineers practice creating layouts with CSS grid.

Engineers will practice implementing the CSS grid by taking the 1st self assessment on Mozilla. If they still have time remaining, they can try the second challenge on the page.

Encourage engineers to share or talk through their process as they move through the challenges. If they run into any obstacles, have them consult a peer, but make sure that their peers are not directly giving them the solution. Guide them through the process of communicating and guiding each other to the solution. 

Be sure to have engineers share their solutions.

<h3>Exercise #7</h3>
 Engineers learn  how to style properties when an element enters a special state.

Direct engineers to  w3 schools. The coach will show engineers how to use online documentation by explaining pseudo-class syntax before sending groups to experiment with properties and explore themselves.

Challenge engineers to work in groups, if possible, to experiment with the following css pseudo-classes on the code repository.  After time ends, engineers will share their findings.

Nth-Child(n)


<h3>Exercise #8</h3>
Engineers learn how to define style properties by using seamless transitions in CSS.

Coaches should guide engineers through CSS transitions through one of the following examples:
Potential code-along prompts:
Make a div red when hovered using a seamless transition
Make a button ‘shake’ when clicked by moving it a few pixels in each direction before returning back to its original position
The code along should answer the following questions:
What CSS properties affect a transition?
How can an engineer find resources online to build the perfect CSS transition?
How can an engineer test their code to ensure a transition works in the IDE.
