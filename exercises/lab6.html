Exercise #6
Engineers practice creating layouts with CSS grid.
Engineers will practice implementing the CSS grid by taking the 1st self assessment on Mozilla. If they still have time remaining, they can try the second challenge on the page.

Encourage engineers to share or talk through their process as they move through the challenges. If they run into any obstacles, have them consult a peer, but make sure that their peers are not directly giving them the solution. Guide them through the process of communicating and guiding each other to the solution.

Be sure to have engineers share their solutions.
