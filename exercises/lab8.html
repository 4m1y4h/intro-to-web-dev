Engineers learn how to define style properties by using seamless transitions in CSS.
Coaches should guide engineers through CSS transitions through one of the following examples: Potential code-along prompts: Make a div red when hovered using a seamless transition Make a button ‘shake’ when clicked by moving it a few pixels in each direction before returning back to its original position The code along should answer the following questions: What CSS properties affect a transition? How can an engineer find resources online to build the perfect CSS transition? How can an engineer test their code to ensure a transition works in the IDE.
